	<h3 class="post-subhead">The Concept</h3>
	<p>To communicate the nature of the event, I developed a strategy that revolved around several illustrations of music gear with "faces".</p>

		<p>The first round of drafts started to feel too visually complicated. I scaled back the shadows and got rid of some strokes to simplify the visual.</p>

	<p class="caption">Second round draft.</p>
	<p>At this phase, I also began to play with background elements to express the varied nature and subject matter of the performances.</p>

	<h3 class="post-subhead">The Refined Concept</h3>
	<p>After a round of reviews, we decided to axe the gear-focues approach for the illustration, and experiment instead with robots. The goal was to emphasize the event's tech focus over the musical aspect.</p>

	<p>This approach borrowed color and pattern strategy from the previous version, but incorporates a more tangible face.</p>

	<h3 class="post-subhead">Final Promos</h3>
	<p>The finished print pieces represent the execution of the overall strategy, using the same type of illustration on each with varying personalities for every season.</p>
