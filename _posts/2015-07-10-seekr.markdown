brief: "Seekr was born out of a desire to make it easier for travelers to have authentic experiences, provided by knowledgeable locals. In the spring of 2015, I teamed up with Nick Clement (CEO), Alia Munger (UX Lead), Catie Czajkowski (Product Manager), and Danny Tran (Lead Developer) to create an experience-driven platform for adventurous travelers."
homepage-brief: "Seekr bridges the gap between adventurous travelers &amp; independent local guides."

	<h3 class="post-subhead">The Logo</h3>
	<p>My first goal was to create a mark to represent Seekr. The logo needs to be recognizable without relying heavily on a specific language, must stand out in the heavily saturated travel market, and should emphasize quality of experience over convenience.</p>
</section>

<section class="wrapper post-section">
<img src="/content/seekr/seekr-logos__initial--sketches.png" alt="Initial Logo Sketchs." />
<p class="caption">Initial logo sketches.</p>
<p>The script “s” form had an immediate appeal due to its glyph-ish appearance, and its similarity to a meandering path.</p>

	<p>After refining the curves &amp; thickness, I created a set of initial lockups.</p>

	<p>The stroke variation began to feel a bit overblown. A further iteration focused on refining the contrast and ensuring the mark’s clarity at large and small scales.</p>

<!-- Color Studies -->

<section class="wrapper post-section">
	<h3 class="post-subhead">Color Studies</h3>
	<p>With the logo feeling well on its way, my next point of focus was on color. My goal was to determine how we might use color to inject vibrance into the Seekr visual identity.</p>
	<img src="/content/seekr/seekr-color-studies__sources.jpg" alt="Source material for color studies.">
	<p class="caption">Source material for color studies.</p>
	<p>I started with source material pulled from a handful of CC0 sources, ensuring that the material represented a wide swathe of travel-related imagery.</p>
</section>

<section class="wrapper post-section">
	<img src="/content/seekr/seekr-color-studies__process.gif" alt="Color-picking process.">
	<p class="caption">Color-picking process.</p>
	<p>Each image was processed in order to determine both the variety of hues and the balance of color. In some instances, there was a final global adjustment to punch up the palette’s vibrance.</p>
</section>

<section class="wrapper post-section">
	<p>An in-depth case-study of this process can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/re-write/case-study-seekr-color-studies-b4ed6692aa1b" style="text-decoration: underline;">here.</a> Below are a few examples combined with tag lines.</p>

<!-- Brand Materials -->

<section class="wrapper post-section">
	<h3 class="post-subhead">Brand Materials</h3>
	<p>Our team determined to develop a handful of materials to express Seekr’s core brand values. These included screen-printed bandanas, custom-printed disposable cameras, and a series of illustrations for digital use.</p>

<!-- Atomic Design -->

<section class="wrapper post-section">
	<h3 class="post-subhead">User Interface</h3>
	<p>With the “why” figured out, it was time to start focusing on the “how” of Seekr. In my case, this meant determining the UI building blocks. We opted for an approach based on Brad Frost’s “atomic” design &ndash; designing from small to large, rather than starting with screens and creating assets later.</p>

	<p>One of the most crucial pieces to create was the card-based system for displaying information about local guides, experiences, &amp; locations. I developed a set of details panels to accompany a grid display that would facilitate a frictionless browsing experience for travelers.</p>

	<p>Details panels pull from the backend database to display information directly on the grid. Using REST states, our plan is to make these views shareable for travelers, and embeddable for guides.</p>

	<p>With a set of UI elements in place, I set out to mock up the MVP  landing page for Seekr. Through card-based design principles, we are able to launch with a very simple design, allowing 80% of the functionality to play out on a single screen.</p>
